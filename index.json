	"content": "VMware Aria Automation | Action Constants and Secrets: VMware Aria Automation 8.14 was used for this Blog Post. When new versions of VMware Aria Automation are released, the code may need to be changed.\nAll the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code.\nI wanted to share how I use Action Constants and Secrets within VMware Aria Automation. Action Constants are a great to have a variable that can be used with many Actions where the value may change. Instead of having to edit 10s or 100s of Actions, you change One Action Constant and all the Actions are updated instantly. Main reason to use Secrets is to keep the values of Passwords out of the code! Plus, like Action Constants, if a Password would change, all you need to do is change one Secret and all your Actions and Templates are automatically Updated. Secrets can also be used in the yaml code of Templates.\nAction Constants Action Constants Use Cases:\nvCenter Username vCenter FQDN VMware Aria Automation Config Username VMware Aria Automation Config FQDN salt master FQDN Any value used in Actions that may change from time to time To access Action Constants: Assembler/Extensibility/Actions/Actions Constants\nYou will see the Action Constants Names and Values. How to use Action Constants and Secrets with an Action:\nAdd the Action Constants and Secrets used within the Action in the Default inputs section. To use a Action Constant value within the Action PowerShell code use $inputs.\u0026ldquo;Action Constant\u0026rdquo; To use a Secret value within the Action PowerShell code use $context.getSecret($inputs.\u0026ldquo;Secret Name\u0026rdquo;) In the example code, review how I am connecting to the vCenter. No hard coded Username, Password or vCenter FQDN. If any of these values would change, I would never need to edit the Action, only the Action Constants and Secret. Link to code | GitHub Repository Secrets Secrets Use Cases:\nPasswords Any value you don\u0026rsquo;t want displayed in plain text within your code To access Secrets: Assembler/Infrastructure/Secrets/Secrets\nYou will see the Secret Names and Description only. You can never see the Secret value after you create it. If you think the value is not correct you need to re-enter the value. How to use Secrets with an Template:\nAdd code to the template yaml that is like this: password: \u0026lsquo;${secret.UbuntuPassword}\u0026rsquo; See Screen Shot Links to resources about Actions Constants and Secrets: Secret Automation Assembler properties How can I create extensibility action constants When I write my blogs, I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. This article is just one way that you could accomplish this task. I am showing what I felt was a good way to complete the use case but every organization/environment will be different. There is no right or wrong way to complete the tasks in this article. "

	"content": "HUGO v0.32 minimum required to use this theme The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you donâ€™t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following this great documentation for beginners.\nInstallation We assume that all changes to Hugo content and customizations are going to be tracked by git (GitHub, Bitbucket etc.). Develop locally, build on remote system.\nBefore start real work:\nInitialize Hugo Install DocDock theme Configure DocDock and Hugo Prepare empty Hugo site Create empty directory, which will be root of your Hugo project. Navigate there and let Hugo to create minimal required directory structure:\n$ hugo new site . AFTER that, initialize this as git directory where to track further changes\n$ git init Next, there are at least three ways to install DocDock (first recommended):\nAs git submodule As git clone As direct copy (from ZIP) Navigate to your themes folder in your Hugo site and use perform one of following scenarios.\n1. Install DocDock as git submodule DocDock will be added like a dependency repo to original project. When using CI tools like Netlify, Jenkins etc., submodule method is required, or you will get theme not found issues. Same applies when building site on remote server trough SSH.\nIf submodule is no-go, use 3rd option.\nOn your root of Hugo execute:\n$ git submodule add https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock.git themes/docdock Next initialize submodule for parent git repo:\n$ git submodule init $ git submodule update Now you are ready to add content and customize looks. Do not change any file inside theme directory.\nIf you want to freeze changes to DocDock theme itself and use still submodules, fork private copy of DocDock and use that as submodule. When you are ready to update theme, just pull changes from origin to your private fork.\n2. Install DocDock simply as git clone This method results that files are checked out locally, but won\u0026rsquo;t be visible from parent git repo. Probably you will build site locally with hugo command and use result from public/ on your own.\n$ git clone https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock.git themes/docdock 3. Install DocDock from ZIP All files from theme will be tracked inside parent repo, to update it, have to override files in theme. download following zip and extract inside themes/.\nhttps://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/archive/master.zip Name of theme in next step will be hugo-theme-docdock-master, can rename as you wish.\nConfiguration"
